# Storage Power Week
HPE CSI Driver in action

A Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver for Kubernetes. #
The HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes allows you to use a Container Storage Provider (CSP) to perform data management operations on storage resources. The architecture of the CSI driver allows block storage vendors to implement a CSP that follows the spec (a browser friendly version).

It allows a complete separation of concerns between upstream Kubernetes core, SIG Storage (CSI owners), CSI driver author (HPE) and the backend CSP developer.
